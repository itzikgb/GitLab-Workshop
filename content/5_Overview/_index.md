# GitLab is the open DevOps platform

Help you to iterate faster, innovate together: Our open DevOps platform is a single application for  collaboration, visibility, and development velocity.

Many customers choose to adopt GitLab in a gradual process, starting with the use case where they feel the greatest pain.  Typically they start with either Source Code Management or Continuous Integration.  Sometimes they start with agile project management, but most often it’s SCM or CI.  Then, over time, they adopt more capabilities in GitLab including Security and Continuous Delivery.   The common theme that we hear from customers is that as they adopt more breadth of GitLab capabilities, they uncover greater and greater value.   Having the developer/delivery workflow in a single application like GitLab, means that teams are able to collaborate and partner to increase delivery velocity and reduce friction.  They are faster and have less overhead because they are in one solution.  I think it’s important to ensure that you appreciate and understand the value that GitLab can bring, not as a point solution, but as a solution to your end to end software delivery lifecycle.
One user interface to learn
One place to manage and control access
One place to track and audit compliance
One place to automate pipelines to ensure quality and security
One place to manage and orchestrate deployments to production
One place to plan and manage the product backlog
One place to prioritize business goals and epics---and then track through delivery.

Only GitLab can cover all the bases in a single application and streamline your application delivery practices and processes.
