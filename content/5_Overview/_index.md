# GitLab - the open DevOps platform


**GitLab helps you to iterate faster, innovate together.**

**Our open DevOps platform is a single application for  collaboration, visibility, and development velocity.**


- One user interface to learn
- One place to manage and control access
- One place to track and audit compliance
- One place to automate pipelines to ensure quality and security
- One place to manage and orchestrate deployments to production
- One place to plan and manage the product backlog
- One place to prioritize business goals and epics---and then track through delivery.


Only GitLab can cover all the bases in a single application and streamline your application delivery practices and processes.
